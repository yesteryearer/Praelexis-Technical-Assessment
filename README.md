# Praelexis-Technical-Assessment
An assessment exercise employed by the Praelexis Recruitement Team. The task is to build a simple model using the PyMC package on the Twitter Airline Sentiment dataset.

## Usage

### Recreating the Environment

Included are the `requirements.txt` and `environment.yml` from my local conda environment. This allows others to recreate the environment easily by running ``conda create --name <envname> --file requirements.txt`` or ``conda env create -f environment.yml``.

## Project Navigation

### Models
The models directory contains two subdirectories, namely `complete` and `incomplete`. The `complete` directory contains the two models to be submitted for evaluation of the assessment. The models contained within the `incomplete` directory were preserved to exhibited my exploration of ideas.

### Research Result
The research results are contained within a technical report within the `report` directory.
